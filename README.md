# Star Wars Character Encyclopedia

## Disclaimer

Hello, dear reviewer(-s)!

I have tried my best to fulfill all the requirements of this home task.
It's been challenging from many aspects.
Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to do everything:

- the app doesn't look as good as it could on both mobile and desktop.
- usage of the tech stack could be better

However, I have learned a lot during the making of this project and I'm sure
this knowledge will aid me in the future.

Thank you for your time!
