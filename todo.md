## TODO

## Data handling

- Move Character data from main page (Home/Character list) to individual page (Character details):
- Refactor main page to display character name and a short description
- **Character description** could be smth like: `character.name` is from `character.homeworld`, is of species `character.species`, was born in `character.birthYear`, has been in the following films `character.films`.

### Splitting the character data

- Create a single-character page => `[id]` page in NextJs
- Add data query and request - Paste the OG query and data request (change later to DRY)
- Get data to render
- Change the Home page look (maybe move data part to a new component)

## UI look

- Mobile first, look pretty, TBD
